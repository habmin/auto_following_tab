# Load 'Following' tab by default on Twitter

Is 'For You' just not for you? Tired of clicking on the 'Following Tab' every time you load Twitter? Here's a simple extension that does it for you, everytime you load Twitter for the first time.

## Behavior

- When logging on to `twitter.com/home`, script will wait for page to load first, then select `Following`.
- If logging on to any other section of Twitter, such as `twitter.com/messages` or `twitter.com/notifications`, the script will wait until the user clicks on the `Home` tab, then wait for the `For You`/`Following` tabs to load, then select `Following`.
- Tested to be compatible with Firefox 109+ and Chrome 109.0.5414.75+

## Installation
Download by clicking `<> Code`, then `Download ZIP` in the upper right of the repository. 

### For Chrome
1. Extract downloaded folder
