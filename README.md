# Load 'Following' tab by default on Twitter

Is 'For You' just not for you? Tired of clicking on the 'Following Tab' every time you load Twitter? Here's a simple extension that just saves you a click, but one that you probably forget to do each time.

## Behavior

- When logging on to `twitter.com/home`, script will wait for page to load first, then select `Following`.
- If logging on to any other section of Twitter, such as `twitter.com/messages` or `twitter.com/notifications`, the script will wait until the user clicks on the `Home` tab, then wait for the `For You`/`Following` tabs to load, then select `Following`.
- Script is designed to work that you have already signed in Twitter before hand. After logging in successfully, refresh the page for the script to activate.
- Doesn't read any sort of Twitter data (literally just telling the DOM to click on the Following tab).
- Tested to be compatible with Firefox 109+ and Chrome 109.0.5414.75+
